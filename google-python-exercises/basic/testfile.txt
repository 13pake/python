Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi.
This is a test file.
I like test files.
They taste like cheeseburgers sometimes.
Other times they taste like tomatoes.
But tomatoes are occasionally inside of cheeseburgers.
This results in an infinite loop of taste.
Speaking of taste, this loop deviates from the Standard of Taste.
But regardless, I still like cheeseburgers.
I wonder if this test file will count the periods.
